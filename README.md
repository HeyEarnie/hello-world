Hey coders of the world!

My name is Jack, I currently work for a software company as a non-techncal implementation consultant helping our customers implememt our software into their business. Plenty of project management and a bunch of setup/configuration in the user interface of our softwares but nothing more technical than that. I'm learning to code for myself as a new learning challenge but also wanted to learn something that I could eventually apply to my career in some way. I think I'm probably going to be more interested in the 'data' languages like SQL and Python but I'm working through freecodecamp and codecademy on what seems to be the best path for newbies: HTML > CSS > JavaScript etc.

I also like functional fitness, mountain biking, and pizza. Those are listed in ascending order of importance :)
